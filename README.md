## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Having one set font size in the body as px then setting everything else using em for better responsivity and saving code.

```css
body {
  font-size: 15px;
}

.title h1 {
  font-size: 5em;
  padding: 0.5em 0 0.25em 0.5em;
  border: 2px solid #fff;
}
```

### Continued development

Starting off with one main px font size in the body, then using em as the unit for everything else (font sizes, padding, margin etc.).

### Useful resources

- [A Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helpful for learning a larger selection of properties you can use with flexbox.
